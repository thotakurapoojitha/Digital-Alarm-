# Digital-Alarm Clock-
A digital alarm clock ⏰ built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functions like a real bedside clock within the browser. It displays live time that updates every second and triggers a sound 🔔 when the selected alarm time is reached. The application demonstrates core browser concepts such as DOM manipulation, timing functions, and event handling while maintaining a clean and responsive interface 💻.

The HTML structure 🏗️ organizes the layout with a central container for the clock display, an input field for selecting alarm time, buttons to set or clear alarms, and a hidden audio element for playback 🎵. All components are aligned neatly in a centered design and implemented using plain vanilla code without external frameworks.

CSS styling 🎨 enhances readability and visual appeal through digital-style fonts, subtle glow effects, gradient backgrounds, and responsive button interactions. Large, clearly spaced digits 🔢 ensure the time remains legible across desktops and mobile devices 📱.

JavaScript 🧠 powers the functionality by updating the clock every second using setInterval and the Date() object ⏱️. Alarm scheduling is handled through setTimeout, which triggers audio playback 🔊 and confirmation alerts when the target time is reached. Clearing an alarm safely removes pending timers, ensuring accurate and controlled behavior throughout the application.
